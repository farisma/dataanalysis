#index is the label or name for each row, by default it will have 0,1,2,...
# we can set the index with any column, it doesnt have to be unique but its bnetter to be unique
# above we are seetting index as country. we can also set it using set_index function
df.set_index('Country) #other method
#this will set the country as the first column

#this will reset index to default 0,1,2 etc, in place means it wont create another DF, existing df will be used.

#to set index again
df.set_index('Country',inplace=True)

#we can use two ways to search after setting index
#loc and iloc method

df.loc['Zimbabwe'] - return the row with country value is zimbabwe
df.iloc[1] - return the first row

#can also set multiple indexes
df.reset_index(inplace=True)

df.set_index(['Continent','Country'],inplace=True)
df.sort_index() - will sort on the basis of continent first and country next
df.sort_index(ascending=False)

df.loc['Albania'] #will return error because first index is continent and albania is not there
#can meniton both indexes to get the correct result, this will search europe in continet and albania in country columns
df.loc['Europe','Albania'] 

df.iloc[1] #iloc will not work for multiindexing, it will return the item in the position mentioned based
